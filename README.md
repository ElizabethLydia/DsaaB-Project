The second step:
1.work out the simple GUI to visualize the picture and the outcome
2.because the picture is compressed when visualizing, so the computeShortestPath has some problems. However if you use the original picture to computeShortestPath, it works well.
3.To do:
a.figure the compressed problem
b.understand the code
c.make it can continuously select the borders.//
